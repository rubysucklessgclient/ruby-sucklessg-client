Extremely simple ruby script to interact with https://sucklessg.org

Requires only standard ruby libraries for reading threads and posts.

For writing a post, the program requires imagemagick to display the captcha, and requires an editor program. By default it tries $EDITOR, emacs, vi and nano. You can set EDITOR to something like kate, gvim, or gedit for a gui editor. The script also depends on `mktemp` which should be available on any linux distro by default.

In the future, if this website doesn't die, all dependencies will be stripped out of the script other than Ruby, and post reading/writing will be made easier and more interactive.

The script can be run in interactive mode (by starting it with no arguments), or commands can be passed from cli like `./sucklessg.rb write 129` (which would write a reply to the specified post with that ID)

Pull requests welcome. I understand the code isn't very readable. I will work on that if there is any interest. I don't know if this whole thing will have any continued interest though.
